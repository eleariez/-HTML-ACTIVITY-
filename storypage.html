    <p>
      Long ago, in a peaceful village nestled between emerald mountains and a winding river, lived a gentle maiden named Sampaguita. She was admired not only for her beauty but for her kindness, patience, and unwavering faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sampaguita was deeply in love with a brave young warrior who protected their land from invaders. Before leaving for battle, he promised that no matter how long the war lasted, he would return to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning, she waited by the river where they last parted, believing that love and destiny would guide him safely back home.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div id="middle" class="story-section">
    <p>
      Days slowly turned into months, and months into years, yet the warrior did not return. Rumors spread through the village, but Sampaguita refused to let doubt poison her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through storms and scorching heat, she continued her daily vigil by the river, praying for his safety. Her devotion never wavered, even as loneliness weakened her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fateful night, as rain poured endlessly, Sampaguita whispered her final prayer and closed her eyes, still clinging to the promise that love never breaks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="ending" class="story-section">
    <p>
      At dawn, the villagers searched for Sampaguita but could not find her. In her place bloomed small white flowers, filling the air with a sweet fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elders said the flowers carried her final words:
      <span style="color:#9dffb0; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:0 0 10px #9dffb0;">
        “Sumpa kita”
      </span>
      —a sacred promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day on, the Sampaguita flower became a symbol of purity, loyalty, and love that never fades.
